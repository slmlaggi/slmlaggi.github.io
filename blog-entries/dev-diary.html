		<h1>Dev Diary</h1>
		<h3 class="date">Date: 18-07-24</h3>
		<p>The 12th of July marked the end of term, and I dove right into my summer TODO list. Naturally, I kicked
			things off with
			the profile page. I initially estimated about 15 hours to transform my rough ideas into a
			polished,
			device-friendly masterpiece (Spoiler alert: mobile web UI/UX design is not my favorite!). Of course, it took
			much
			longer than
			planned, but I still had learnt a lot from this experience. Since I didn’t track every single change during
			the development process, I’ll share a simple
			timeline of my
			thoughts and progress in this entry.
		<h2>Day 0 [12-07-2024]: The about page.</h2>
		<p>I started with an early draft of the About page. Ignoring mobile resizing, I created a full-screen section
			with about
			ten words per page — definitely an odd design choice! I also added favicon icons to spruce things up. After
			around four
			hours of work, I had laid out my initial ideas for the page.</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 4</h3>
		<h2>Day 1 [13-07-2024]: Socials hell</h2><img src="./blog-images/dev-diary.webp">
		<p>I spent the entire weekend (13th and 14th July) working without committing any changes because I wanted to
			finish the
			Socials part before going live. Day 1 was a bit chaotic; I wasn’t at my desk all day but still
			managed around
			six hours trying to make the Socials page smooth. I borrowed some widget ideas from bento.me, which I
			had used as my
			socials link page beforehand. Although it worked, it felt a bit clunky to deploy on a single page.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 10</h3>
		<h2>Day 2 [14-07-2024]: More dev work</h2>
		<p>
			I decided it was better to create a separate page for my playlists instead of cramming them into the already
			cluttered
			Socials page. More debugging ensued, along with some reworking of JavaScript functions and styles. I also
			stayed up
			until 5:30 AM to watch Spain win the Euros.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 17</h3>
		<h2>Day 3 [15-07-2024]: Mobile go brr</h2>
		<p>
			I spent an hour or two redesigning the mobile layout to improve user-friendliness. Productivity was low
			since I was
			pretty sleepy after the previous night.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 20</h3>
		<h2>Day 4 [16-07-2024]: Fixed color palette and some more positioning stuff </h2>
		<p>
			This day was a mix of tidying up directories and making backups, along with bursts of inspiration for color
			choices and
			positioning tweaks. The site was mostly complete at this point, though the About page still needed some
			fixing.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 24</h3>
		<h2>Day 5 [17-07-2024]: Brainf**k</h2>
		<p>
			I woke up determined to finish everything today. I revamped the About page functionalities
			and
			redesign in about three to four hours. Creating the skills tab was interesting but came with its challenges.
			Just as I
			was ready to publish, I remembered my past experience with TypeScript and decided to rewrite the entire
			index.js in
			TypeScript to refresh my skills. This led to seven hours of rewriting and troubleshooting. By nearly 11 PM,
			everything
			was finally working despite having a few minor design issues.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 38</h3>
		<h2>Day 6 [18-07-2024] (TODAY): Bug hunting and fixing</h2>
		<p>
			There were about 10 or so minor bugs and places there could be improved, however nothing
			really
			changed in the design and alignment aside from small fixes. Cleaning up the entire project directory
			and
			stuff later its finally done! Only things left is to add more blog entries, hopefully at least once per
			month
			or more
			frequently.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 45</h3>
