		<h1>Dev Diary</h1>
		<h3>Date: 18-07-24</h3>
		<p>The 12th of July was the last day of term, so I started working on my TODO list for the summer break. What
			other
			project than to start with this profile page? I originally thought this would take about 15 hours or so of
			work to
			go from only the blog page and slight drafted ideas of the other pages to a completely finished page that is
			legible
			with all devices (Spoiler alert: I hate mobile.), but of course it would take much longer than
			expected.
			Since I didn't commit every single change I made throughout the entire dev process of the website, I'll walk
			through
			a simple timeline of my thought and dev process in this entry.
		<h2>Day 0 [12-07-2024]: The about page.</h2>
		<p>This was an early draft version of the about page, so I ignored any mobile viewport resizing and basically
			made it a
			full screen section with like 10 words per page and you had to scroll down a whole lot for the next part.
			Very odd
			design but we move. I also added the favicon icons and stuff that made it theoretically look better when
			opened. A
			few hundred additions to the files, nothing too special after around 4 hours of development.</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 4</h3>
		<h2>Day 1 [13-07-2024]: Connections hell</h2><img src="./blog-images/dev-diary.webp">

		<p>Ok, so you might be wondering, laggi, what the hell happened around here? Basically, I was working
			without
			committing for the entire weekend (13th, 14th July). This was because I didn't expect myself to publish
			my page
			before at least the connections part had finished. Day 1 was a bit weird, since I wasn't spending the entire
			day
			working on the project (I had multiple matches to ref in OST), but I still put in around 6 hours to try and
			make the
			connections page work smoothly. I did steal a bit of idea about the widgets from bento.me, which I used
			previously
			as my socials link page. Despite the implementation working, I still didnt like it very much since it was
			chonky.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 10</h3>
		<h2>Day 2 [14-07-2024]: More dev work</h2>
		<p>
			I realized it would be better to make an individual page for my playlists instead of stuffing up my already
			full
			socials page. Plus I fetched the entire iframe from lastfmstats and didn't really mind throwing it
			straight onto
			my
			page lol. Other than that, more debugging and remaking the js functions, styles, etc. Stayed up till
			530am to
			watch
			Spain win the Euros as well :3c
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 17</h3>
		<h2>Day 3 [15-07-2024]: Mobile go brr</h2>
		<p>
			Basically spent an hour or two redesigning the mobile layout to be at least a
			little bit more user friendly. Didn't really have much productivity though since I was sleepy asf after
			staying
			up
			late :p. Also because I had to test out the pool for both OST and 6WC24 HK Tryouts and that took way
			longer than
			expected.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 20</h3>
		<h2>Day 4 [16-07-2024]: Fixed color palette and some more positioning stuff </h2>
		<p>
			Spent the day on and off tbh, sometimes I was reordering and tidiyng up my directories and making backups,
			sometimes
			I had a moment of inspiration and put some colors or repositioning on the site. Site was mostly finished
			at this
			point but the About page still needs a redesign.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 24</h3>
		<h2>Day 5 [17-07-2024]: SELF TORTURE</h2>
		<p>
			Woke up feeling I had to finish the project today.
			It started off well, I got the about page functionalities and redesign done by around 1pm (3-4 hours in),
			making the
			skills tab was quite interesting and caused a few issues at first but fixed pretty quickly.
			I was this close to publishing the site when I saw that I had technically worked with TypeScript before, so
			I put it
			in the skills tab.
			Then I had a crazy idea. Why not rewrite the entire index.js into TypeScript? That way I would be able to
			refresh my
			TypeScript skills.. or so I thought.
			Cue the 7 hours spent on rewriting and wondering why shit won't work like expected, pouring over the
			documentary and
			stuff.
			Took me till almost 11pm to finalize the design with everything working. Welp that wasn't as perfect as
			planned, but
			we move.
		</p>
		<h3>Cumulative hours count: 38</h3>
		<h2>Day 6 [18-07-2024] (TODAY): Bug hunting and fixing</h2>
		<p>
			There were about 10 or so minor bugs and places there could be improved (8 were on mobile ffs), nothing
			really
			changed in the design and alignment aside from small fixed lol. Cleaning up the entire project directory
			and
			stuff later its finally done!! Only things left is to add more blog entries, hopefully at least once per
			month
			or more
			frequently :3c Signing off nya~
		</p>
