<h3>Date: [18-07-24]</h3><br>
<p>The 12th of July was the last day of term, so I started working on my TODO list for the summer break. What other
	project than to start with this profile page? I originally thought this would take about 15 hours or so of work to
	go from only the blog page and slight drafted ideas of the other pages to a completely finished page that is legible
	with all devices (Spoiler alert: I hate mobile.), but of course it would take much longer than expected.<br><br>
	Since I didn't commit every single change I made throughout the entire dev process of the website, I'll walk through
	a simple timeline of my thought and dev process in this post. <br><br>
<h2>Day 0 [12-07-2024]: The about page.</h2><br>
<p>This was an early draft version of the about page, so I ignored any mobile viewport resizing and basically made it a
	full screen section with like 10 words per page and you had to scroll down a whole lot for the next part. Very odd
	design but we move. I also added the favicon icons and stuff that made it theoretically look better when opened. A
	few hundred additions to the files, nothing too special after around 4 hours of development.</p><br>

<h2>Day 1 [13-07-2024]: Connections hell</h2><br><img src="src/blog-entries/blog-images/dev-diary.webp"> <br><br>
<p>Ok, so you might be wondering, laggi, what the hell happened around here? <br> Basically, I was working without
	committing for the entire weekend (13th, 14th July). <br>This was because I didn't expect myself to publish my page
	before at least the connections part had finished. Day 1 was a bit weird, since I wasn't spending the entire day
	working on the project (I had multiple matches to ref in OST), but I still put in around 6 hours to try and make the
	connections page work smoothly. <br>I did steal a bit of idea about the widgets from bento.me, which I used
	previously
	as my socials link page. Despite the implementation working, I still didnt like it very much since it was chonky.

<h2>Day 2 [14-07-2024]: More dev work</h2><br><br>
<p>
	I realized it would be better to make an individual page for my playlists instead of stuffing up my already full
	socials page. <br>Plus I fetched the entire iframe from lastfmstats and didn't really mind throwing it straight onto
	my
	page lol. <br>Other than that, more debugging and remaking the js functions, styles, etc. Stayed up till 530am to
	watch
	Spain win the Euros as well :3c

<h2>Day 3 [15-07-2024]: Mobile go brr</h2><br><br>
<p>
	Basically spent an hour or two redesigning the mobile layout to be at least a
	little bit more user friendly.<br> Didn't really have much productivity though since I was sleepy asf after staying
	up
	late :p. <br>Also because I had to test out the pool for both OST and 6WC24 HK Tryouts and that took way longer than
	expected.

<h2>Day 4 [16-07-2024]: Fixed color palette and some more positioning stuff </h2><br><br>
<p>
	Spent the day on and off tbh, sometimes I was reordering and tidiyng up my directories and making backups, sometimes
	I had a moment of inspiration and put some colors or repositioning on the site. <br>Site was mostly finished at this
	point but the About page still needs a redesign.

<h2>Day 5 [17-07-2024]: SELF TORTURE</h2><br><br>
<p>
	Woke up feeling I had to finish the project today.<br>
	It started off well, I got the about page functionalities and redesign done by around 1pm (3-4 hours in), making the
	skills tab was quite interesting and caused a few issues at first but fixed pretty quickly.<br><br>
	I was this close to publishing the site when I saw that I had technically worked with TypeScript before, so I put it
	in the skills tab.<br>
	Then I had a crazy idea. Why not rewrite the entire index.js into TypeScript? That way I would be able to refresh my
	TypeScript skills.. or so I thought. <br>
	Cue the 7 hours spent on rewriting and wondering why shit won't work like expected, pouring over the documentary and
	stuff. <br>
	Took me till almost 11pm to finalize the design with everything working. Welp that wasn't as perfect as planned, but
	we move.

<h2>Day 6 [18-07-2024] (TODAY): Bug hunting and fixing</h2><br><br>
<p>
	There were about 10 or so minor bugs and places there could be improved (8 were on mobile ffs), nothing really
	changed in the design and alignment aside from small fixed lol.<br> Cleaning up the entire project directory and
	stuff later its finally done!! Only things left is to add more blog posts, hopefully at least once per month or more
	frequently :3c<br><br> Signing off nya~
