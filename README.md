# slmlaggi's Page

Design (should be) finalized. Content will be updated regularly in the future.

## TODO

- [x] Finish remaining pages of connections, about me, music
- [x] Make site legible for mobile users
- [ ] Fix error: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'ch-ua-form-factors' (Unfixable for now)
- [x] Fix other remaining errors when they appear/get reported
- [ ] Add OpenGraph to every page to improve the look of embeds
- [x] Add sufficient comments such that it can function as a website template
- [ ] Add view counter if possible (Need to setup server side with ExpressJS, maybe in the future)
- [ ] Add project page when more projects
- [ ] Keep updating blog posts
