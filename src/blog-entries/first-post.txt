<p>So hyped about finally starting my webpage project!! Even though I know it'll probably take so long because of procrastination and busy schoolwork, I aim to finish it hopefully by the end of 2022~ Currently still struggling with making the css work and it's been more of a challenge for me since I barely have touched webdev before this, but I'm looking forward to learning new things and ideas through working on this passion project!</p>
<p>See you guys around and have a nice day nya~~<br>

<p>P.S. Neko rushia clip that I love a lot ðŸ¦‹ðŸ’–</p>
