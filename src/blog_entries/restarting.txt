<p>Hihi~ It's me, Laggi, 2 years since I started this profile page project! The last 2 years were much too eventful, plus I was busy completing the rest of CS50 and doing other side projects in python. That's why this page got left behind and unattended for.. but now I'm back to working on it! (sort of)<br>
While I was clearing and moving my wsl stuff, I found this folder ðŸ˜¿ and thought to myself, why not try and continue on? Welp here I am, about a week into restarting this project and I've at least cleared the basic functionality and design of the home landing page and this blog!! With about 800+ lines of HTML, SCSS (Learnt it just for this purpose), and JS, the site is finally starting to take shape...<br>
Unfortunately, my finals will be coming in 3 weeks at the time of writing, so I'll have to drop this for about a month before I can pick it up again. Can't wait to see you guys on the next blog update~!<br>
Also pls watch this cool pass on Kokou no Sousei... Probably my best osu! score up until now <img src="./src/blog_entries/blog_images/neko_threaten.png" alt="Mikeneko threatening" width=64px height=64px/></p>
